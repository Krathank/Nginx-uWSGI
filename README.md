You need to disable SELinux or add a rule for nginx SELinux to workaround the permission denied/502 Bad Gateway issue.

Here are the steps:

If you are getting 502 Bad Gateway, then check logs cat /var/logs/nginx/error.logs
I was getting something like (13: Permission denied) while connecting to upstream ...
Check the status of SELinux using sestatus
If it says enabled, vi into /etc/sysconfig/selinux. This is a symlink to /etc/selinux/config so modify this file in case you donâ€™t find the above file. Terminal command: sudo vi /etc/sysconfig/selinux
The file is highly self-explanatory. Just change the value of SELINUX to disabled
Most important step - REBOOT! sudo reboot



disabling SELinux is not always an option, especially when running an app on a openly available server.
Should you have the annoying issue with nginx and its Bad Gateway 502 error, you might want to allow connections through httpd. To accomplish that without turning off SELinux you can run the following command:

sudo semanage permissive -a httpd_t
This will allow nginx to manage connections without disabling SELinux (source).
As mentioned above, restart the services, or better reboot the server to allow changes to take effect.
Hope to be helpful!
